@workspace You are now in Agent Mode for the Perplexity_dashboard project, advancing to Phase 3A Step 4 based on the enhanced roadmap with scalping timeframes. Follow this structured protocol to implement in synergy with Perplexity AI. My project root is C:\Users\haroo\OneDrive\Documents\My Projects\Perplexity_dashboard. All helper files are in C:\Users\haroo\OneDrive\Documents\My Projects\Perplexity_dashboard\Help files for Prompt.

Protocol Rules:
1. First, review the enhanced roadmap from: Overall-Roadmap-Updated.md (in Help files for Prompt folder).
2. Then, execute instructions for Phase 3A Step 4 from: Phase3A-Step4-Instructions.md (also in Help files).
3. For each step, confirm understanding, perform actions (e.g., install deps, create/edit files, run tests).
4. If a step involves commands, provide exact Terminal/PowerShell versions (e.g., npm install ml-matrix --save) and wait for my confirmation to run them manually.
5. If any error occurs (e.g., pattern recognition issues, timeframe enhancement errors):
   - Try a simple fix once (e.g., check imports, restart server, verify file paths).
   - If unresolved, create a report file: phase3a-step4-error-report.txt in the Help files for Prompt folder. Include: full error trace, affected file/line, your fix attempt, relevant code/project state, scalping timeframe implementation status.
   - Instruct me: "Error detected. Report saved to phase3a-step4-error-report.txt. Share this with Perplexity AI for enhanced analysis, then paste the updated Perplexity AI prompt here to resume."
6. Halt on errors until resolved.
7. On full phase completion, output: "Phase 3A Step 4 Advanced Pattern Recognition + Scalping Timeframes - COMPLETE! âœ…" and provide test commands (e.g., to test enhanced timeframes and pattern detection).
8. Stay precise: Use project-exact paths/names (e.g., src/services/patterns/patternRecognitionEngine.js), assume Node.js/Express/MongoDB setup from Phase 3A Step 3.

Key Implementation Files Available in Help files for Prompt:
- patternRecognitionEngine.js (Core pattern detection engine)
- patternModel.js (Enhanced database models for scalping)
- timeframes.config.js (Enhanced timeframe configuration)
- candlestickPatterns.js (Candlestick pattern detection)

Enhanced Objectives for Phase 3A Step 4:
- Extend timeframes: Add 1m, 3m, 15m to existing 5m, 1h, 1d for scalping optimization
- Implement 20+ pattern recognition (candlesticks, chart patterns, Smart Money)
- Create scalping signal generation with multi-timeframe confluence
- Build pattern API endpoints: /api/v4/patterns/* and /api/v4/scalping/*
- Integrate basic ML for pattern confidence scoring

Success Criteria:
- Ultra-fast timeframes (1m, 3m, 15m) operational
- Pattern detection with >70% accuracy
- Sub-minute scalping signal generation
- Multi-timeframe confluence system working
- API response time <200ms for pattern endpoints

Confirm workspace access and Help files availability. Then, start with reviewing Overall-Roadmap-Updated.md, followed by Phase3A-Step4-Instructions.md Step 1.
