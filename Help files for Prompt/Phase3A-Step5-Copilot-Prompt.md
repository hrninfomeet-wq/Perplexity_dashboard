@workspace You are now in Agent Mode for the Perplexity_dashboard project, advancing to Phase 3A Step 5 based on the ML-enhanced roadmap. Follow this structured protocol in synergy with Perplexity AI. My project root is C:\Users\haroo\OneDrive\Documents\My Projects\Perplexity_dashboard. All helper files are in C:\Users\haroo\OneDrive\Documents\My Projects\Perplexity_dashboard\Help files for Prompt.

Protocol Rules:
1. First, review the ML-enhanced roadmap from: Overall-Roadmap-Updated.md (in Help files for Prompt folder).
2. Analyze Phase 3A Step 4 implementation: Verify patternRecognitionEngine.js has placeholder methods that need ML enhancement. Confirm backend stability and pattern recognition operational.
3. Then, execute instructions for Phase 3A Step 5 from: Phase3A-Step5-Instructions.md (in Help files).
4. For each step, confirm understanding, perform actions (e.g., install ML deps, create/edit files, test ML models).
5. If commands needed, provide exact Terminal/PowerShell formats (e.g., npm install ml-matrix simple-statistics brain.js --save) and wait for my confirmation to run them manually.
6. If error occurs (e.g., ML model training issues, neural network setup problems):
   - Try a simple fix once (e.g., check ML library imports, adjust model params, verify async functions).
   - If unresolved, create report: phase3a-step5-error-report.txt in Help files for Prompt folder. Include: error details, file/line, attempted fix, ML model config, code snippets, project state.
   - Instruct me: "Error encountered. Report saved to phase3a-step5-error-report.txt. Share this with Perplexity AI for ML analysis, then paste revised Perplexity AI prompt here to continue."
7. Do not advance past errors.
8. Upon completion, output: "Phase 3A Step 5 ML-based Signal Enhancement - COMPLETE! âœ…" and provide verification commands (e.g., test ML-enhanced signal APIs).
9. Be efficient: Use exact project paths/names (e.g., src/services/ml/mlSignalEnhancer.js); stick to roadmap; build on Node.js/Express/MongoDB/Pattern Recognition from Step 4.

Key ML Implementation Files Available in Help files for Prompt:
- mlSignalEnhancer.js (Core ML signal enhancement engine)
- mlModel.js (ML database models and schemas)
- ml.config.js (ML configuration and parameters)

Enhanced Objectives for Phase 3A Step 5:
- ML Signal Enhancement: Advanced confidence scoring using machine learning
- Predictive Models: Neural networks for price movement prediction
- Ensemble Methods: Multiple ML models for superior accuracy
- Performance Learning: Adaptive algorithms that improve from results
- Complete Pattern Implementation: Finish Chart & Smart Money patterns with ML

Success Criteria:
- 25% improvement in signal accuracy with ML enhancement
- <200ms processing time for ML-enhanced signals
- >70% accuracy in price movement prediction
- Ensemble system outperforming individual models by 15%
- Performance learning from trading results operational

Confirm workspace access and Help files availability. Then, start with roadmap review, followed by Phase 3A Step 4 analysis, then proceed to Step 5 implementation.
