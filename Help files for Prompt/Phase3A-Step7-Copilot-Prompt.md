@workspace You are now in Agent Mode for the Perplexity_dashboard project, reviewing Phase 3A Step 6 and advancing to Step 7. Follow this structured protocol in synergy with Perplexity AI. My project root is C:\Users\haroo\OneDrive\Documents\My Projects\Perplexity_dashboard. All helper files are in C:\Users\haroo\OneDrive\Documents\My Projects\Perplexity_dashboard\Help files for Prompt.

Protocol Rules:
1. First, review the updated roadmap from: Overall-Roadmap-Updated.md (in Help files for Prompt folder).
2. Analyze Phase 3A Step 6 implementation: Verify files like riskManagementEngine.js for efficiency (e.g., <200ms VaR, ML-Kelly integration). Apply fixes from roadmap (e.g., add strategy integration stubs, optimize performance). Confirm backend stability; note frontend deferral.
3. Then, execute instructions for Phase 3A Step 7 from: Phase3A-Step7-Instructions.md (in Help files).
4. For each step, confirm understanding, perform actions (e.g., install deps, create/edit files, test code).
5. If commands needed, provide exact Terminal/PowerShell formats (e.g., npm install lodash --save) and wait for my manual confirmation/execution.
6. If error occurs (e.g., strategy conflicts, integration issues):
   - Attempt one efficient fix (e.g., adjust logic, add async handling).
   - If unresolved, generate report: phase3a-step7-error-report.txt in Help files for Prompt. Include: error details, file/line, attempted fix, code snippets, project state.
   - Instruct me: "Error encountered. Report saved to phase3a-step7-error-report.txt. Attach to Perplexity AI for analysis, then paste revised Perplexity AI prompt here to continue."
7. Do not advance past errors.
8. Upon completion, output: "Phase 3A Step 7 Advanced Trading Strategies - COMPLETE! âœ…" and provide verification commands (e.g., test strategy API endpoints).
9. Be efficient: Use best practices (modular code, error-handling, optimization); stick to roadmap; exact paths/names (e.g., src/services/strategies/tradingStrategiesEngine.js); build on Node.js/Express/MongoDB/Multi-API/ML/Risk setup.
10. Do not get stuck in a loop while executing a command. Learn from past mistakes. Create a rule set internally to avoid same mistakes again
