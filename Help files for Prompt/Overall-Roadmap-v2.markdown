# NSE Trading Dashboard - Overall Roadmap v2

## Project Overview
The NSE Trading Dashboard is an enterprise-grade trading platform for real-time market analysis and trade recommendations. As of September 6, 2025, the project is at Phase 3A Step 8 (Live Trading Integration, complete with 730+ req/min capacity, 92.6% DB test success). Backend is production-ready; frontend is outdated, requiring a professional revamp.

## Roadmap Phases

### Phase 3A: Advanced Technical Analysis (Current)
- **Step 9: Professional Trading Experience & Frontend Redesign** (1-2 weeks, Q3 2025)
  - Objectives: Revamp frontend to Bloomberg/Reuters-style UI; integrate multi-API portals, paper trading, backend APIs (v7); add charting, real-time viz.
  - Dependencies: Backend v7 APIs, MongoDB models, WebSocket feeds.
  - Tasks: Audit frontend, modify connect button, revamp dashboard, integrate WebSocket, link APIs, enable paper trading UI, test, update docs.
  - Risks: Market closure (use simulated/crypto data); frontend complexity may delay.
- **Step 10: Backtesting & Optimization** (1-2 weeks, Q3 2025)
  - Objectives: Implement backtesting engine for strategies; optimize parameters using ML feedback; validate performance metrics (e.g., 60-70% win rate).
  - Dependencies: Step 9 UI for results display; backend strategies/DB.
  - Tasks: Create backtesting service, integrate with DB, add UI for results, test with historical data, optimize ML models.

### Phase 3B: Multi-Asset Platform (Q4 2025)
- Objectives: Add crypto (Binance, CoinGecko), US equities, Forex; enable cross-asset correlation.
- Tasks: Integrate new APIs, update DB models, enhance UI for multi-asset views, test correlations.
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks.
- Risks: API rate limits; data consistency across markets.

### Phase 4: AI-Powered Analytics & Autonomy (Q4 2025)
- Objectives: Enhance ML for predictions, sentiment analysis; enable autonomous trading with user authorization; achieve top 1% profitability via backtesting.
- Tasks: Upgrade ML models, add sentiment analysis, implement execution APIs, integrate compliance checks, deploy to production.
- Timeline: 3-4 weeks.
- Risks: Regulatory compliance; live trading stability.

### Phase 5: Deployment & Scaling (Q1 2026)
- Objectives: Full production deployment; support 1000+ users; mobile optimization.
- Tasks: Deploy on cloud, optimize for scale, develop mobile app, add enterprise features.
- Timeline: 4-6 weeks.
- Risks: Scalability bottlenecks; mobile compatibility.

## Timeline Summary
- Q3 2025: Complete Phase 3A (Steps 9-10).
- Q4 2025: Complete Phase 3B & 4 (multi-asset, autonomy).
- Q1 2026: Full deployment, scaling.
- Total to Completion: ~2-3 months for fully functional engine.

## Key Considerations
- **Frontend Priority**: Step 9 critical for usability; defer mobile to Phase 5.
- **Testing**: Use simulated/crypto/historical data due to market closure.
- **MCP Servers**: Leverage Context7/Memory for context, Codacy for quality, SequentialThinking for execution.
- **Goal Alignment**: Top 1% profitability achievable with rigorous backtesting, risk management, simulated-to-live progression.
