Prompt For Claude Opus 4.1
In the mock-up file please note the details for clarification:

5. All the individual panels should be auto-resizing, adjustable according to the page resizing or windowed condition.
6. You can see that I have added a new panel in the page's right hand side with heading or name "Analyse scrip" with a search bar below it. Any stock or index can be searched in this search bar for trade recommendation analysis. The backend calculation and functionality of this panel shall be developed later.
7. The "settings" panel shall also move out of the "Sidebar" and placed at the right bottom side as shown on the mock-up page.
