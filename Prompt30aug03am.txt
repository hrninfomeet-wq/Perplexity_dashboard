Analyse my project files - frontend and backend to deeply understand the project structure, architecture, functionalities, layout and user interface. 
First we need to focus on the existing dashboard design and rectify the design issues. The panels visible on my dashboard page namely F&O Analysis, Market Analysis, Scalping Opportunities, BTST Scanner, Settings, are not arranged properly for viewing on the page. The tables and panels are not arranged neatly. There is no horizontal scrolling option for the page. Because of this the panels like Market Analysis, Scalping Opportunities are not visible on the right edge. See screenshot of the web page. If the tables and panels auto-resizing when the browser is windowed, and there is vertical and horizontal scrolling for the entire page, the page would be somewhat better.
Our main objective is to improve the frontend UI and design make it intuitive for stock trading, market monitoring, easy to use. The UI should clean, efficient, light, and high performing. You can also suggest improvements for the design like a highly profitable trader and web developer.
