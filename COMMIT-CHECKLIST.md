## 🚨 FAILURE TO UPDATE PROJECT SUMMARY = INCOMPLETE COMMIT

**The project summary file is the single source of truth for project status and must be updated with every significant change.**

---

### Quick Update Template for Project-summary.md:

```markdown
#### Latest Update (DATE):
- **✅ Feature/Change**: Description
- **✅ Component**: What was modified/added/removed  
- **✅ Performance**: Any improvements or metrics
- **✅ Architecture**: Structural changes

*Last Updated: [DATE]*
*Project Status: [Current Status]*
```

---

**Remember: A commit without updated documentation is an incomplete commit!**
